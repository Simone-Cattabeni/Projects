# Projects
A collection of codes from my contributions to research projects or practicals

Hi, welcome to my collections of codes (R) from my research projects ("SustainPalm_") and practicles ("Forest_model"). Please feel free to browse them!

In SustainPalm, I explored the effect of 3 oil palm trunks (OPT) management practices on soil biodiversity and soil health. This research was possible thanks to SMART Research Institute (SMARTRI).
Results lead to my MSc thesis: "Impact of Post-Replanting Oil Palm Trunks Management Practices on Biodiversity and Soil Health in the Oil Palm Landscape" which was awarded a 9/10 at Wageningen University & Research. Currently, I am working on a possible journal publication.

At the moment, I am focused on exploring the potential of Python for image analysis and machine learning. 

Thank you for reading and hopefully meet you soon!
